Light foot
-------------------
As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice,
even using other people as cover. Youâ€™re inclined to be
affable and get along well with others. In the Forgotten
Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and
thus are the most common variety.
Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other
halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take
up a nomadic life. In the world o f Greyhawk, these
halflings are called hairfeet or tallfellows.
