Sailor
--------
You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that
time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters o f the
deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the
bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of
the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand
at something new.
Discuss the nature o f the ship you previously sailed
with your Dungeon Master. Was it a merchant ship,
a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship?
How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely traveled?
Is it still sailing, or is it m issing and presumed lost
with all hands?
What w ere your duties on boardâ€”boatswain, captain,
navigator, cook, or some other position? W ho were the
captain and first mate? Did you leave your ship on good
terms with your fellows, or on the run?
