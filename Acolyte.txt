Acolyte
--------
You have spent your life in the service o f a temple
to a specific god or pantheon o f gods. You act as an
intermediary between the realm o f the holy and the
mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering
sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the
presence o f the divine. You are not necessarily a
cleric-performing sacred rites is not the same thing as
channeling divine power.
Choose a god, a pantheon o f gods, or some other
quasi-divine being from among those listed in appendix
B or those specified by your DM, and work with your
DM to detail the nature o f your religious service.
Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from
childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or
were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call
to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were
the leader o f a small cult outside of any established
temple structure, or even an occult group that served a
fiendish master that you now deny.
