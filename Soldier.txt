Soldier
--------
War has been your life for as long as you care to
remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of
weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques,
including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You
might have been part o f a standing national army or a
mercenary company, or perhaps a member o f a local
militia w ho rose to prominence during a recent war.
When you choose this background, work with your
DM to determine which military organization you w ere
a part of, how far through its ranks you progressed, and
what kind o f experiences you had during your military
career. Was it a standing army, a town guard, or a village
militia? Or it might have been a noble’s or merchant’s
private army, or a mercenary company.
