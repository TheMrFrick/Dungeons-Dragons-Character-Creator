Outlander
-----------
You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the
comforts o f town and technology. You’ve witnessed the
migration o f herds larger than forests, survived weather
more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend,
and enjoyed the solitude o f being the only thinking
creature for miles in any direction. The wilds are in
your b lood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a
recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in
places where you don’t know the specific features o f the
terrain, you know the ways o f the wild.
