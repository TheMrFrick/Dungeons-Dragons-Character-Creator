Noble
--------
You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You
carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects
taxes, and wields significant political influence. You
might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with
work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated
to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a
disproportionate sense o f entitlement. Or you could be
an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply
about the people who live and work on your land, keenly
aware o f your responsibility to them.
Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate
title and determine how much authority that title
carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s
connected to an entire family, and whatever title you
hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not
only do you need to determine your noble title, but you
should also work with the DM to describe your family
and their influence on you.
Is your family old and established, or was your title
only recently bestowed? How much influence do they
wield, and over what area? What kind o f reputation
does your family have among the other aristocrats o f the
region? How do the common people regard them?
What’s your position in the family? A re you the heir
to the head o f the family? Have you already inherited
the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or
are you so far down the line o f inheritance that no one
cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the
family? How does the head o f your family feel about
your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good
graces, or shunned by the rest o f your family?
Does your family have a coat o f arms? An insignia you
might w ear on a signet ring? Particular colors you w ear
all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol o f your
line or even a spiritual member o f the family?
These details help establish your family and your title
as features o f the world o f the campaign.
