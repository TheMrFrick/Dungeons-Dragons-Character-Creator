Goliath
----------
Goliaths share a number of traits in common
with each other.

Ability Score Increase. 
------------------------
Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score
increases by 1.

Age. 
------
Goliaths have lifespans comparable to humans.
They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live
less than a century.

Alignment. 
-----------
Goliath society, with its clear roles
and tasks, has a strong lawful bent. The goliath
sense of fairness, balanced with an emphasis on selfsufficiency
and personal accountability, pushes them
toward neutrality.

Size. 
-------
Goliaths are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh
between 280 and 340 pounds. Your size is Medium.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Natural Athlete. 
------------------
You have proficiency in the Athletics skill.

Stone’s Endurance. 
--------------------
You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage,
you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce
the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you
can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Powerful Build.

You count as one size larger when
determining your carrying capacity and the weight you
can push, drag, or lift.

Mountain Born.

You’re acclimated to high altitude,
including elevations above 20,000 feet. You’re also
naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in
chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

Languages. 
------------
You can speak, read, and write Common and Giant.
