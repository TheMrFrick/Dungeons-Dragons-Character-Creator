Dark Elf (Drow)
-------------------------
Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned
elves, the drow were banished from the surface world
for following the goddess Lolth down the path to
evil and corruption. Now they have built their own
civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned
after the Way o f Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow
have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and
stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have
very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in
shades o f lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to
be smaller and thinner than most elves.
Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist
in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see
if you can play a drow character.
