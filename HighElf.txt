As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of

(which includes the gray elves and valley elves of
Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the
sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and
reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to
non-elves and even other elves. The other type
(including the high elves of Greyhawk. the
Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves
of the Forgotten Realms) are more common
and m ore friendly, and often encountered
among humans and other races.
The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold
elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and
hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their
eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also
called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler,
with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue.

not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and
