Urchin
--------
You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor.
You had no one to watch over you or to provide for
you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought
fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other
desperate souls w ho might steal from you. You slept on
rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and
endured sickness without the advantage o f medicine or
a place to recuperate. Youâ€™ve survived despite all odds,
and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some
combination o f each.
You begin your adventuring career with enough
money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days.
How did you come by that money? What allowed you to
break free of your desperate circumstances and embark
on a better life?
