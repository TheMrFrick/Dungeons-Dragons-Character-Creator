Guild Artisan
--------------
You are a member o f an artisanâ€™s guild, skilled in
a particular field and closely associated with other
artisans. You are a well-established part o f the
mercantile world, freed by talent and wealth from the
constraints o f a feudal social order. You learned your
skills as an apprentice to a master artisan, under the
sponsorship o f your guild, until you became a master in
your own right.
